# Reflow946

The Reflow946 is a Bluetooth LE temperature controller for the 946C electronic hot plate. Using this controller, a reflow profile can be programmed from your web browser using the [Web Bluetooth](https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/) API. You can use preset profiles (e.g. for lead-free or leaded soldering) or create a custom profile for a perfect cheese fondue. ðŸ«•

The controller board is intended to replace the original controller board. It is **only compatible with the 3 buttons variant** pictured above (see this [teardown](https://youtu.be/Gv2sRJ9y_Ok)). Please send a PR if you adapted the design to a new variant.

## Hardware

The controller is based on a ESP32 module with an IPEX antenna. Since the metal case acts as a Faraday cage, the BLE signal can be improved by taping an antenna outside of the case.
